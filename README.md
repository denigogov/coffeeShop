## CoffeShop

**This is one of the first websites I created during my early learning phase**. It serves as a testament to my progress and growth as a web developer. The website showcases my foundational knowledge of HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## Future Migration to React

In the future, there are plans to migrate this project to React to take advantage of its component-based architecture and enhanced development capabilities. By migrating to React, we aim to improve code organization, maintainability, and introduce additional features.



## Getting Started

To run the website locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/website-repo.git
   
1. Open the repository folder.

2. Locate the HTML file (index.html) and right-click on it.

3. Choose "Open with Live Server" from the context menu. This will launch the website in your default browser using a local development server.
